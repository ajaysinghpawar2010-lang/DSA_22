/*
1. Insertion:
insert(): Adds a new key-value pair. If the key already exists, insert() typically does not modify the element, depending on the overload used.
operator[]: Inserts a new key-value pair if the key doesn't exist, or updates the value if the key already exists.
emplace(): Constructs a new key-value pair in-place, potentially offering better performance than insert() for complex types.
try_emplace() (C++17 onwards): Inserts a new element only if the key does not already exist.
2. Accessing Elements:
operator[]: Retrieves the value associated with a given key. If the key doesn't exist, it inserts a new element with a default-constructed value and returns a reference to it.
at(): Retrieves the value associated with a given key. If the key doesn't exist, it throws an std::out_of_range exception. 
3. Deletion:
erase(): Removes elements from the map. It can remove a specific element by key, a specific element by iterator, or a range of elements by iterators.
clear(): Removes all elements from the map, leaving it empty.
4. Searching and Information:
find(): Searches for a key and returns an iterator to the corresponding element if found, or an iterator to end() if not found.
count(): Returns the number of elements with a specific key. For std::map, this will always be 0 or 1 due to unique keys.
lower_bound(): Returns an iterator to the first element whose key is not less than the given key.
upper_bound(): Returns an iterator to the first element whose key is greater than the given key.
equal_range(): Returns a pair of iterators representing the range of elements with a specific key (for std::map, this will be a range of at most one element).
size(): Returns the number of elements in the map.
empty(): Checks if the map is empty, returning true if it is, false otherwise. 
5. Iteration:
begin(): Returns an iterator to the first element of the map.
end(): Returns an iterator to the element past the last element of the map.
rbegin(): Returns a reverse iterator to the last element of the map.
rend(): Returns a reverse iterator to the element before the first element of the map.
